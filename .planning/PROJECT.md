# Explain that InChI

## What This Is

A single-page public web tool for chemists and chemistry students to understand the structure of an InChI (IUPAC International Chemical Identifier) string. Users draw a molecule in an embedded Ketcher editor; the InChI is computed live and displayed below with each layer colour-coded and interactive. Hovering over a layer highlights the corresponding atoms or bonds in the molecule canvas and surfaces a per-layer explanation card.

Shipped as a static build to GitHub Pages (no server, no backend). All InChI computation runs in-browser via Ketcher's built-in WASM library.

## Core Value

Every chunk of an InChI string is hoverable, explained, and linked back to the atoms in the drawing — demystifying a notation that most chemists treat as opaque.

### Active (v2 candidates)

- [ ] MAP-03: Current molecule state encoded in URL (hash or query param) for bookmarking/sharing — deferred from v1 during Phase 6 planning
- [ ] ACCS-01: Full keyboard navigation of the InChI layer display (Tab through layers, Enter to activate hover)
- [ ] ACCS-02: Screen reader labels on all layer color swatches and legend rows
- [ ] CONT-01: Additional preset molecules beyond the 10 in v1 (e.g. amino acids, common drugs)
- [ ] CONT-02: Molecule search by name or InChI string
- [ ] APPR-01: Dark mode toggle with adapted design tokens
- [ ] APPR-02: Print styles for the explanation panel

### Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Backend / Indigo server | ketcher-standalone runs entirely in-browser via WASM |
| User accounts / persistence | Stateless educational tool; URL sharing covers the core use case |
| 3D structure viewer | InChI is a 2D notation; 3D adds scope without illuminating InChI |
| Database / substructure search | Shifts product identity away from the explainer tool |
| Mobile-native app | Web-first; Ketcher canvas is not well-suited to touch input |
| Language localisation | English-only for v1; deferred |

## Context

- Design reference: `./design_handoff_explain_that_inchi/` (styles.css, molecules.js, layers-info.js, app.jsx, canvas.jsx)
- Deployed: GitHub Pages (`gh-pages` branch), GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- All parsers ported from design handoff JS and TypeScript-ified with tests
- Highlight system: `buildHighlightSpecs` / `buildSubHoverSpecs` → `useKetcherHighlights` hook → `highlights.create` Ketcher API
- Atom mapping: `getInchi(true)` returns InChI + AuxInfo; AuxInfo parsed to canonical→Ketcher pool-ID map

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Vite + React 18 + TypeScript | Specified in design handoff; required by ketcher-react | ✓ Good — no issues |
| ketcher-standalone (no Indigo backend) | Browser-only deployment requirement | ✓ Good — works perfectly |
| Port parsers from molecules.js verbatim | Parsers are final, tested, and domain-correct | ✓ Good — saved significant time |
| Aux-info getInchi(true) for atom mapping | Only source of canonical→Ketcher mapping | ✓ Good — canonical approach confirmed |
| @vitejs/plugin-react v6 (esbuild, not SWC) | SWC crashes on Ketcher packages (issue #5565) | ✓ Good — esbuild works cleanly |
| All Ketcher packages pinned to 3.12.0 | Avoid version skew between ketcher-react/standalone/core | ✓ Good — no version conflicts |
| StandaloneStructServiceProvider at module level | WASM re-initializes if created inside component | ✓ Good — critical architectural choice |
| Separate vitest.config.ts from vite.config.ts | Vitest 3 bundles Vite 6 internally; Plugin type conflict if merged | ✓ Good — clean separation |
| vite-plugin-static-copy v4 + assetsInlineLimit:0 | WASM assets must be served as files, not base64-inlined | ✓ Good — no WASM 404s |
| CSS Modules + CSS custom properties | Preserves oklch token system; Tailwind 3.x doesn't support oklch | ✓ Good — zero token conflicts |
| MAP-03 (shareable URL) deferred to v2 | Scope management during Phase 6 | — Pending (v2 Active) |
| getInchi(true) split on AuxInfo= prefix | Concatenated string, not destructurable | ✓ Good — robust parsing |
| useRef for editor.subscribe handler | Avoids stale closures in event subscription | ✓ Good — prevents subtle bugs |

## Constraints

- **Tech stack**: Vite + React 18 + TypeScript — matches what `ketcher-react` expects
- **No backend**: `ketcher-standalone` provides WASM InChI; everything runs in-browser
- **Styling**: CSS modules + CSS custom properties — preserves the oklch token system from `styles.css`
- **Deployment**: static build (GitHub Pages); no server-side rendering
- **Fidelity**: high — colour palette, typography, spacing, and hover behaviour are final from the handoff
