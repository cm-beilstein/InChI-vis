## Project

**Explain that InChI**

A single-page public web tool for chemists and chemistry students to understand the structure of an InChI (IUPAC International Chemical Identifier) string. Users draw a molecule in an embedded Ketcher editor; the InChI is computed live and displayed below with each layer colour-coded and interactive. Hovering over a layer highlights the corresponding atoms or bonds in the molecule canvas and surfaces a per-layer explanation card.

**Core Value:** Every chunk of an InChI string is hoverable, explained, and linked back to the atoms in the drawing — demystifying a notation that most chemists treat as opaque.

### Constraints

- **Tech stack**: Vite + React 18 + TypeScript — matches what `ketcher-react` expects
- **No backend**: `ketcher-standalone` provides WASM InChI; everything runs in-browser
- **Styling**: vanilla CSS modules or Tailwind — must preserve the CSS variable token system from `styles.css`
- **Deployment**: static build (GitHub Pages or Netlify); no server-side rendering
- **Fidelity**: high — colour palette, typography, spacing, and hover behaviour are final from the handoff

## Technology Stack

## Recommended Stack
### Core
| Layer | Choice | Version | Confidence |
|-------|--------|---------|-----------|
| Build tool | Vite | ^8.0 (latest) | HIGH |
| UI framework | React | ^18.2 | HIGH |
| Language | TypeScript | ^5.x | HIGH |
| Molecule editor | ketcher-react | 3.12.0 | HIGH |
| Standalone WASM provider | ketcher-standalone | 3.12.0 (keep in sync) | HIGH |
| Type definitions | ketcher-core | 3.12.0 (keep in sync) | HIGH |
| State management | Zustand | ^5.0.13 | HIGH |
| Styling | CSS Modules + CSS custom properties | (built into Vite) | HIGH |
| Deployment | Netlify (primary) / GitHub Pages (fallback) | — | MEDIUM |
### Supporting Libraries
| Library | Version | Purpose | When to Use |
|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| vite-plugin-static-copy | ^2.x | Copy Ketcher WASM/worker assets from node_modules to dist/public | Required — WASM files must be served at a known URL |
| @vitejs/plugin-react | ^4.x | React fast-refresh, JSX transform | Required — use standard esbuild plugin (not SWC variant) |
| coi-serviceworker | latest (copy from repo) | Polyfill COOP/COEP headers via Service Worker | Required only for GitHub Pages; not needed on Netlify |
## Rationale
### Vite 8 + react-ts template
### React 18, not React 19
### ketcher-react + ketcher-standalone + ketcher-core — all at 3.12.0
- `ketcher-react` — exports the `Editor` React component and `ButtonsConfig` type
- `ketcher-standalone` — exports `StandaloneStructServiceProvider` (WASM-backed, no server needed)
- `ketcher-core` — exports `Ketcher` type (used for typing the `onInit` callback result)
- `getInchi(withAuxInfo?: boolean): Promise<string>` — the `true` overload returns InChI + AuxInfo block containing the canonical→Ketcher atom mapping the project needs
- `setMolecule(mol: string): Promise<void>` — used for preset loading
- Structure change events: subscribe via `ketcher.editor.subscribe('change', handler)` — no `onChange` prop on `<Editor>`; the editor event bus is the mechanism
- `onInit` callback: `<Editor onInit={(ketcher: Ketcher) => void}>`
- `staticResourcesUrl` prop: must point to where `help.md`, `library.sdf`, and WASM asset files are served. In Vite, set to `''` or `'/'` — the files must be physically present at that URL via the `vite-plugin-static-copy` step below
### Zustand 5 for state management
### CSS Modules — do NOT use Tailwind
- `oklch()` color space (Tailwind 3.x doesn't support oklch natively; Tailwind 4 does but adds migration cost)
- ~60+ CSS custom properties as a structured token system
- Precise typographic tokens (IBM Plex Sans/Serif/Mono via `@font-face` or Google Fonts)
## Build and Deploy Considerations
### Vite config skeleton
### WASM + SharedArrayBuffer: what we actually know
### GitHub Pages deployment
- Include `coi-serviceworker.js` as a standalone file in `public/` (must not be bundled)
- Add `<script src="/coi-serviceworker.js"></script>` as the first script in `index.html`
- The service worker intercepts all requests and injects the missing headers, causing a single page reload on first visit
# netlify.toml
### TypeScript tsconfig notes
## What NOT to Use
| Rejected Choice | Why |
|----------------|-----|
| `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc` | Confirmed SWC panic crash when processing ketcher packages (issue #5565). Use standard `@vitejs/plugin-react` (esbuild) |
| React 19 | ketcher-react peerDeps are `^18.2.0`; React 19 upgrade PR (#6657) not merged in 3.12.0 stable |
| Tailwind CSS | Would require duplicating all oklch token definitions from the canonical `styles.css`; CSS Modules work with CSS variables natively without duplication |
| Redux Toolkit | Massive overkill for a store with 6-7 fields; no async side effects requiring middleware |
| Styled-components / Emotion | Runtime CSS-in-JS is unnecessary here; the token system is CSS variables which CSS Modules handle natively |
| `indigo-ketcher` direct import | This is a transitive dependency of `ketcher-standalone`; do not import it directly — only the ketcher packages' public API (`StandaloneStructServiceProvider`) should be used |
| Server-side rendering (Next.js) | The project constraint is a static build; Next.js adds SSR complexity and breaks Ketcher's browser-only WASM initialization |
| RC releases of ketcher (3.15.x, 3.16.x) | Not stable releases; changelog shows they target macromolecule/polymer features irrelevant to this tool |

## GSD Workflow Enforcement

Before using Edit, Write, or other file-changing tools, start work through a GSD command so planning artifacts and execution context stay in sync.

Use these entry points:
- `/gsd-quick` for small fixes, doc updates, and ad-hoc tasks
- `/gsd-debug` for investigation and bug fixing
- `/gsd-execute-phase` for planned phase work

Do not make direct repo edits outside a GSD workflow unless the user explicitly asks to bypass it.
